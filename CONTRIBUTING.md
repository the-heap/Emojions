# General Contributing
If you want to contribute you should follow these steps.

1. Go to our [issues](https://github.com/the-heap/Emojions/issues/)
2. Look for issues that might appeal to you / aren't already being worked on.
3. Assign an issue to yourself and comment to let me know you're tackling something
4. Fork the repo to your own profile and work on a branch there.
5. (optional) Comment along as you work, if you like, to update on progress (Screenshots, thoughts, questions etc)
6. Make a PR!

# Commit Message guidlines.

- Read this [doc](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) over and consider some of it's pointing when commiting code. 
- It's worth it, trust me. 
- I'm open to new of doing things, but the more concise your git commit messages are, the better.
- In case you didn't read the document, I'm going to copy + paste seven rules to consider:

```
Separate subject from body with a blank line
Limit the subject line to 50 characters
Capitalize the subject line
Do not end the subject line with a period
Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Wrap the body at 72 characters
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
```


# Code style and Formatting
I can't be too picky here because everyone has different standards. But I'm still going to try ðŸ™€
- I will be using git commit hooks to make sure that your code is linted / and pretti-fied. Be prepared!

# How Pull Requests should look.

Your pull requests should be _very_ description. Here are some general tips.
- Reference the issue that the PR closes.
- Include a summary of your changes
- If the UI has changed, post screenshots of the changes.
- If we are writing tests for this project (which we hopefully will do...), don't forget to write tests.
- Don't forget to lint and format your code. 


# Commenting
No jerks.

# Project Opinions 

While The Heap intends to be open to all ideas and opinions; project opinions from contributors (that is, the direction of the project / what we're building) can only be considered to a point. Project opinions are any thoughts from contributors that are directed at changing _what_ we're building. Unfortunately the limited duration of these projects don't really allow for changing the actual project themselves. 

We know that we can't please everybody with what we are trying to build, the main goal here is to make projects of all kinds open and accessible to people of all skill level, that they may contribute and work together. Learn some cool stuff. You know what I mean.
