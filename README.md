We want to create a tool in which any one can embed on their website, a simple "reaction bar" where their respective users can simply click on an emoji and update the count (number of times that emoji has been clicked).

**Emoji-bar**: A container with emojis in it, and the corresponding number of time they have been clicked (think, facebook, slack, github isues etc).

**Snippet**: The embeddable script that allows an end user to add an "emoji bar" to their website

**Client** : Where a user can go to customize their snippet (the emoji's that show up.)

**Api** : A wrapper for the database â€” it allows a user of the emoji bar to store the click count ... somewhere, and then retrieve those amount when they like.
