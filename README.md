Welcome to one of THE HEAP's open projects! For the month of May We're building an embeddeable emoji bar. This project aims to be as accessible as possible to people who want to contribute to open source code! We've got a few things to go over, so if you're new to Github, or contributing to open source software, take a breather and then read on! You got this. üëå

Before we get into the project itself, let's get to know our collaborative environment:
- Most of the activity regarding the project's status happens _right here_ on github, especially on the [issues](https://github.com/the-heap/Emojions/issues) page. Here you can see a [roadmap](https://github.com/the-heap/Emojions/issues/1) for our project, pick out issues, and keep an eye on conversations.
- The Heap will also be making videos to document the process (live coding, demonstrations, "office hours" and so on). Subscribe to the [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIaeBxFZOzLA20sSAUENXRg).
- The Heap has a [Twitter account to tweet](https://twitter.com/theheap_) both about projects and programming (and life, the universe...). Follow us to stay in the loop

For this project, our goal is to create an _embeddable emoji bar_ that users on any website can interact with. This was blatantly inspired by Github issues, and Slack. This is an example image from a Github issue page:

The above is an example of what I call a "reaction bar" ‚Äî an interactive page element in which users can click on an emoji and increment it's respective counter.

# Getting Started

To contribute successfully to this project it might take a bit of time to setup and become aquainted with both the project itself and how you can best add your contributions. The following steps will inform the code you write and help you make good pull requests.

1. Understanding the [project / product](https://github.com/the-heap/Emojions/issues/1)
2. Understanding how to [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. Read Project Components below, for getting setup.

# Project Setup

One important thing to note is that this Repository is a _monorepo_. This means that there are three seperate "sub projects" within this single repo. In this case there is the `snippet`, `client` and `api.` It is essential to understand the differences, and I'll do my best to explain them; consider checking the road map to learn more, and feel free to comment if anything is not clear.

**Snippet** :

```sh
cd snippet
npm install
```

To run the snippet and see it working, you'll need to open the `example.html` page in the build folder to test.

**Client**

`Client` is a bit of a tricky name (I probably could have named this better, but let's stick with it for now). The client is a small web app. The goal of the client is to _provide a place for a user to go to a page and **customize** the emojis they want to show up when they **use the snippet**. example: you run a blog and at the bottom of it you want an emojion bar with `üëîüê¶üêØüé©` at the bottom. The client provides a web interface that will **generate an instance of the snippet** or a user to implement.

```sh
# change directories into /client/
cd client
# install elm deps
npm install
# boot the program!
npm start
```

1. [Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) (follow this entire guide if you can!)
2. Go into your terminal and navigate to the folder `./client` in this repo.
3. Run: `elm reactor`.
4. Go to `localhost:8000`. Elm should download whatever packages you need to run the project.
5. Using elm reactor you can navigate our app. I recommend clicking on the main entry point, which should be `main.elm`.

**Api**

Installation Instructions:

- You'll probably want to have python3 installed. You might already, so try this out! If not, go ahead and [download + install it ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```sh
# change directories into the /api folder
cd api
# ... installing all your deps
make setup
# run the server! ( you will need to stop / start on change yourself.)
make run
```


# Terminology

If you are a bit lost, the following terminology might help to clarify some aspects of the project.

**Emoji-bar**: A container with emojis (:wave:) in it, and the corresponding number of time they have been clicked (think, facebook, slack, github isues etc).

**Snippet**: The embeddable script that allows an end user to add an "emoji bar" to their website

**Client** : Where a user can go to customize their snippet (the emoji's that show up.)

**Api** : A wrapper for the database ‚Äî it allows a user of the emoji bar to store the click count ... somewhere, and then retrieve that amount when desired

# Development Environment
-  **Docker** - you can also use Docker to get started but it is somewhat borked and unfinished. If you know how to fix / make docker work please help me üê≥üêã (I'm trying to get the entire stack launched from docker for easier barrier to entry for contributions. For example; all apps will run in docker (including our front end ‚Äî especially Elm)
- **Testing** - Please refer [to our wiki for how testing works](https://github.com/the-heap/Emojions/wiki/Testing)
