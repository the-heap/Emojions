> This folder represents an entire "sub-project" for the emojion bar project. 

# Overview

If you are feeling lost, I recommend reading the roadmap for [this project](https://github.com/the-heap/Emojions/issues/23)

A quick overview incase you are offline:

> The client is a small webapp that will exist to serve one primary function: allowing a user (someone who wants to embed an emojion bar on their site) to customize their emoji bar â€” choosing which emoji's show up.

> This part of the project will be built with Elm, if we get to it. I'd like to build it with Elm to try something new, get better at functional programming, as well as attract other programmers with different perspectives / interests.

# Getting setup

This part of the project will be written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), a function language that can compile down to javascript. If you feel intimidated by a new language, don't worry! Learning a language is an excellent challenge, and is something I personally wish I had tried earlier. Remember, you don't have to be a master in a language to write in it.

If it makes you feel any better, I have written 0 Elm at the time of starting this project. There is an excellent chance that I will write it poorly, especially because I also have 0 experience writing a functional language. So hopefully others in the community might be able to lend me a hand too!

Let's get setup:

1. [Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) (follow this entire guide if you can!)
2. Go into your terminal and navigate to `./client`. Run: `elm reactor`.
3. Go to `localhost:8000`. Elm should download whatever packages you need to run the project. 
4. Using elm reactor you can navigate our app. I recommend clicking on the main entry point, which should be `main.elm`.
